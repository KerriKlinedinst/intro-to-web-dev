    <p><b><span class="big">Tomorrow when the farm boys find this freak of nature, </span>they will wrap his body in newspaper and carry him to the museum.</b></p>
    <p><b>
      But tonight he is alive <span class="big">and in the north field with his mother.</span>.
              </b></p>
      It is a perfect summer evening:  the wind in the grass.
    <p><b>
       <span class="big">the moon rising over the orchard,</span> the wind in the grass.

              </b></p>
       <p><b>And as he stares into the sky, <span class="big">new life</span></b></p>
            <p><b><span id="boldly">there are twice as many stars as usual.</b></p>
