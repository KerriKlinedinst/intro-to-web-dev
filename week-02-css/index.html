  <p><span>Tomorrow when the farm boys find this
freak of nature,</p></span>
<p>they will wrap his body
in newspaper and carry him to the museum.</p>

<p><i>But tonight he is alive</i></p>
<p>and in the north
field with his mother.</p>

</p>It is a perfect summer evening: the moon rising over
the orchard, <i>the wind in the grass.</i>
<span id="boldly">And as he stares into the sky, there are
          twice as many stars as usual.</span></p>
