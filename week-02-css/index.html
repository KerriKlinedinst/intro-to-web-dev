            <p><b><span class="big">Tomorrow when the farm boys find this freak of nature,</span></b></p>
<p><b><span class="big">they will wrap his body in newspaper and carry him to the museum.</b></p>
    <p><i>
      But tonight he is alive</i><span class="big">and in the north field with his mother.</span></p>

     <p><b> It is a perfect summer evening:  the wind in the grass.
    </p></b>
      <p><b><span class="big">the moon rising over the orchard,</span> the wind in the grass. </b></p>
       <p><b>And as he stares into the sky, <span class="big">new life</span></b></p>
            <p><b><span id="boldly">there are twice as many stars as usual.</b></p>
